I want to generate a report that summarizes a number of git repositories.  All repositories reside at github.com/geekychris.  Each repository has a README.md file.  Generate a REPORT.md that lists each repository and a short summary of each repository.  Each summary should include details of the top 5 pieces of technology used including any machine models.  It should also list the primary programming language used in each repository.  The report should include a table which lists the github repo name, a one liner description, programming language and some kind of classification such as "server ml" or ipad app.
